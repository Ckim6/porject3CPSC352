\subsection{Caesar}

Ciphertext-only attack.

\subsection{Key Exchange Problem}

Alice and Bob both wish to communicate using a secret key cryptosystem. The problem with this is that they both must agree to a key that is only known to them. If anyone else gets the key, like Mallory for example, they can get send messages to Bob from Alice or vice versa. The problem is how do Alice and Bob agree on a key to use without letting it be known to Mallory or anyone else that's eavesdropping on the system.

\subsection{Public Key Attack}

Subject to a man in the middle attack.

\subsection{ADFGVX}

\subsection{Division Algorithm}

Given integers $a$, $b$ with $b > 0$, there exists unique integers $q$, $r$ satisfying $$a = qb + r$$
$$0 \le r < b$$
We say: $q$ is the quotient\\
$b$ is the divisor\\
$r$ is the remainder\\
